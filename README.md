## How to use

```javascript
var NappWaveform = require('dk.napp.waveformview');

// demo file
var file = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory, "demo.mp3");

var view = NappWaveform.createView({
	url: file.nativePath, // path to local file
	doesAllowScrubbing: true, // tap to move the progress
	doesAllowStretchAndScroll: true, // enables zoom
	progressColor: "blue",
	wavesColor: "black",
	width:"300dp",
	height: "150dp"
});
```

## Properties

### url

We only support local native file path. So use a file object. 

	Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory, "demo.mp3").nativePath;

### progressColor

The progress color of the graph. (the selected part)

### wavesColor

The background color of the graph. 

### doesAllowScrubbing

The user can drag the graph.

## API

### setProgressSamples

Set the progress of the graph

	view.setProgressSamples({
		duration:0.5,
		value: 15000 // samples
	});


### totalSamples
Store the total samples - once the audio file has been loaded

	totalSamples = view.totalSamples();

## Events

	willLoad, didLoad, willRender, didRender, change (added in 1.1.0 by @kosso)

Use didRender for your custom logic - here the graph have been loaded and rendered.
